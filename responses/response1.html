				<h2>Humanity & Humour of the Internet</h1>
				<p>I think this reading was very relateable. I mean you see websites all the time and with some you know someone took their time to make it. You can tell there truly is someone behind the madness. But, when it comes to websites that are over done it can feel more robotic and you aren't as connected with it. You want people to be interested in your site and to give them that you have to put in the effort to inspire them and let them feel what you're trying to portray. If I see a good website, it could be designed for anything, as long as it has the power to make me stay and go through it I am interested. Humour would definitely be a way to keep people interested as well. Laughing about stuff is one of the most humane things we do. It is happiness in its best form. I once spent an hour going through a site that had a rubber duck in the middle that spun around and changed colors and hats. It is the small things that can keep you laughing for hours on end. </p>
