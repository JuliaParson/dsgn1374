		<p>After watching this video I was a little confused. I had many questions. <span class="questions">Who is Ted Nelson? What does he stand for? Why do people insist on calling insane for holding onto what he believed in?</span> I decided to do more research and I think Ted Nelsons ideas are interesting. I mean having a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqx6li5dbEY&feature=youtu.be">2 way links</a> system would help a lot of people. I feel as humans we are always evolving and trying to expand our ways and improve them and that kind of efficiency might be what we need.</p>
